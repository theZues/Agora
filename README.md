# Agora

  This is my online store.  I reference items I currently have on eBay, but I wanted to make it a more personable and enjoyable experience for someone who didn't want to go to eBay and look around.  If they know who I am, they could go through my site with my personality showing up on every page.

  ## Approach Taken

  I started off from scratch.  I began with no schema's and built the RESTful routes first.  I then built in the schema's afterwards, then tackled CSS with skeleton at the end.  The link to the site, which I will be changing is https://theagorasite.herokuapp.com/
  
  ## Built With

  •	A basic skeleton template by: https://bypeople.com
  

  ## Problems/Things to work on

  I am still weak in using boostrap.  I tried that first, then moved on to Skeleton.  The edit page can not link to the css file for some reason.  The edit page can not accept a link for an image.
