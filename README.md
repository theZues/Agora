# Agora

  This is my online store.  I reference items I currently have on eBay, but I wanted to make it a more personable and enjoyable experience for someone who didn't want to go to eBay and look around.  If they know who I am, they could go through my site with my personality showing up on every page.

  ## Approach Taken

  I started off from scratch.  I began with no schema's and built the RESTful routes first.  I then built in the schema's afterwards, then tackled CSS with skeleton at the end.  Here's the link https://theagorasite.herokuapp.com/
  
  ## Built With

  *	A basic skeleton template by: https://bypeople.com
  * Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS.
  * MVC file structure.
  * Seven RESTful routes with full CRUD.
  
  
  ## Problems/Things to work on

  I am still weak in using boostrap.  I tried that first, then moved on to Skeleton and the edit page can not link to the css file for some reason.
  
  ## User Stories

  * I can register and log in to see a registered users only section of the site.
  * After I register, I can edit and create my own products. 
  * I can also edit and delete test products that are already there in the registered users section.
  
  ## Achievments


  I used the bcrypt package for encryption so people can sign up and log in to a registered users section on the site.  I used three different models and controllers instead of one like we used in class.
